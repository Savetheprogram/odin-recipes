    <h4>Ingridients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups fresh bread crumbs </li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, melted </li>
        <li>salt to taste </li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste </li>
        <li>½ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese </li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups grated sharp white Cheddar cheese, divided </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives, or to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Recipe</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone liner (such as Silpat®).</li>
        <li>Place bread crumbs in a mixing bowl and pour melted butter over top. Add salt, cayenne, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and mix until evenly coated. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and arrange in an even layer. Sprinkle 1 cup Cheddar cheese over top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Leave the oven on.
        </li>
        <li>Place sweet potatoes in a mixing bowl. Add lemon zest and juice, salt, pepper, cayenne, and melted butter; toss until evenly coated. Immediately transfer sweet potatoes into a buttered baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the oven until potatoes are very tender, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Break up the crispy, cheesy bread crumbs into very small pieces and scatter evenly over the potatoes. Gently press them into the potatoes and sprinkle remaining ¼ cup Cheddar over top.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and bake until browned, 15 to 20 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with chives before serving.</li>
    </ol>
